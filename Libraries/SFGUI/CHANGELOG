Changelog for SFGUI, http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/

0.2.0

Enhancement:
  - Conversion of codebase to use C++11 features.
  - Implemented two backend renderers (one uses vertex buffer objects, the
    other client-side vertex arrays).
  - Generalized renderer textured quad creation from CreateImage into
    CreateSprite allowing Engine developers more freedom to manage resources
    and convey their usage.
  - Allow creation of RadioButtonGroups in advance.

Fixes:
  - Fixed linking and general building errors on OSX.
  - Fixed corner case bug with canvas.
  - Fixed viewports not propagating properly.
  - Fixed index count not being reduced in renderer when primitives are
    removed.
  - Fixed FindSFGUI.cmake ignoring standard arguments.
  - Removed obsolete UpdateViewRect() from sfg::Desktop.
  - Fixed renderer crashing when drawing without any textures loaded into the
    atlas.
  - Fixed loading fonts in renderer.
  - Adapted CMake configuration to the new SFML linking system.
  - Got rid of SFML as an extlib (Git submodule).
  - Cleaned up CMake configuration file.

0.1.1

Enhancements:
  - Compatibility to SFML 2.1.
  - Reimplemented sfg::Canvas.
  - Rewrote sfg::Renderer::Display() interface to allow sf::Windows to be used
    as targets for GUI rendering as well.
  - Added support for multiple pages in the texture atlas to support
    arbitrarily many images and image sizes (that themselves would fit on the
    GPU of course)
  - Added PackStart, PackEnd and ReorderChild to Box to make using it easier.

Fixes:
  - Made sure to restore coherency between wiped states cache and OpenGL
    texture binding by unbinding any bound textures after wiping the cache.
  - Moved spinner RenderQueue update logic into Engine-side code to decouple
    the Widget from it's Engine implementation and make it easier for custom
    Engines to be written for it.
  - Changed CMakeLists.txt to accept SFML 2.x instead of only 2.0.
  - Fixed hiding ACTIVE widgets getting them stuck in ACTIVE state, blocking
    all future events from reaching other widgets.
  - Fixed appending and prepending text to an Entry not properly invalidating
    it.
  - Fixed removing child from table not removing associated cell entry.
  - Changed found message type in FindSFGUI.cmake to STATUS to prevent people
    from being unnecessarily surprised when something worked. #636
  - Fixed clicking on combobox drop-down menu causing window reordering when
    the menu reached over the edge of the parent window onto another window.
    The Desktop now only considers reordering when there is no modal widget
    active. #628
  - Fixed Window not properly ignoring invalid mouse move values. #607
  - Fixed m_parent_notified being uninitialised on first use in Widget. #638
  - Added missing "out of window" check when handling MouseMove events in
    sfg::Scale.
  - Fixed not taking into account padding when determining if the Renderer
    needs to create a new atlas page.
  - Fixed child widgets not notifying tentative parents of the child's
    invalidation if the invalidation took place before it was added to the
    parent and the next update cycle.
  - Added explicit sf::Context construction before querying GLee for supported
    extensions to fix special cases where no sf::Context is available yet thus
    making GLee report wrong extension information.
  - Fixed broken behavior when removing a page from a Notebook, now warns when
    trying to remove the last page of the notebook

0.1.0

Enhancements:
  - Implemented SpinButton widget.
  - Optimized primitive construction and label resizing.
  - Linking to dependencies skipped for Linux systems.
  - Removed (too) specific settings regarding the linker (no more linking to
    static runtime libraries and SFML static linking settings).
  - Examples' data directory copied to CMake build cache directory for easier
    testing when developing.
  - SFGUI_ROOT is now the preferred way of given an extra search path when
    looking for SFGUI through find_package(). The old SFGUIDIR is still
    available.

Fixes:
  - Mouse leaving SFML window causing a very very long scroll action with
    scrollbars, resulting in lag.
  - Uninitialized text margin variable in entry widget.
  - Widgets not automatically refreshing when a property is changed after their
    drawables are constructed.
  - Widgets not automatically refreshing when their ID or class is changed.
  - sf::Event::MouseEntered and sf::Event::MouseLeft not being handled
    properly.

0.0.1

  - FIX: Compatible to latest SFML commit.

0.0.0

  - First release.
